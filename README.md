# Geo-Enabled-Smart-Bins
As technology advances, a greater number of aspects of human existence use it to improve response times to customers by cutting down on latency and speeding up processing. The "smart bins" were one such device. Despite being user-friendly for citizens, it is more useful for organizations, as it uses sensors to generate information on the bin's status, such as if it is full. Our focus is to create a smart bin that is also user-friendly for citizens. With the use of these smart bins, residents can quickly and easily report any issues they are having with the bin to the respected organization. Our objective benefits the organizations as well as the citizens. Our smart bins are equipped with Geospatial technology, so based on citizen complaints about specific bins, an online platform will determine the fastest way to visit every bin in the least amount of time. Using this method, organizations may solve the issue faster and with less personnel. In this way, everyone will become accountable for their locality and the globe will be hygienic.
